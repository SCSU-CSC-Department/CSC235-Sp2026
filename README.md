## Materials

### Textbooks

There are no required textbooks for this course. Online resources pertaining to the topics at hand will be shared with students as applicable.

### Software

This course requires students to use numerous software packages. Every effort will be made to make available all required packages on assigned lab computers, but students are encouraged to install the software on their personal computers as well to achieve a more location-flexible development environment.

#### Text Editor

Each student is expected to achieve proficiency using a text editor of choice. In class, we will be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), a popular and powerful integrated development environtment (IDE) that includes syntax auto-completion functionality for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as easy integration with github repositories. 

#### Browser

Each student is expected to achieve proficiency using a modern browser for web development purposes. The browser must include the ability to inspect underlying elements on the page. The official browser for this course is [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), however [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.firefox.com/en-US/) is another viable option.

#### Local Web Server

Each student is expected to achieve proficiency using a local web server of choice for web development purposes. For this course, we will be using [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/).
